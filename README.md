# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Project
This analysis was created to show the total fares of the ride-sharing app PyBer, broken down by city type over a period of four months (January to April 2019).

## Results
The city type that brought in the most money was "Urban" by far, bringing in $2,000 to $2,500 almost every week during the selected timeframe. The "Suburban" cities hovered around $1,000/week, while the "Rural" cities only reached the $500 mark once. This can be attributed to the urban cities accounting for more than double the amount of rides as the other two city types combined. The urban cities also had far more drivers (2,405) than suburban (490) and rural (78) cities.

## Summary
The disparities in differences could be partially made up by marketing to the rural and suburban areas. There will inevitably always be more demand in urban areas, but advertising in these markets could certainly help bolster numbers. It could also be worth adding an incentive for new drivers in those areas to help make the business more accessible. Along with that, lowering the initial rates for riders in those areas could incentivize customers to try the service.
